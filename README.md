# ðŸš€ Victoria Chan's developer portfolio website

This project has been created using the amazing [Wagtail CMS](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail).

This project is meant to be a minimalistic Wagtail site for showcasing a freelance developer's portfolio and details. I'm hoping to keep the dependencies light so that this website can be cheaply (if not freely) hosted using minimal resources.

## Installation

We use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) to set up a local build for development.

### Dependencies

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### To build the container:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/victoriachan/developer-portfolio.git
cd developer-portfolio
docker-compose build
```

### To start the container and gunicorn, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The local site will now be accessible at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) and the Wagtail admin
interface at [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/).


### To run bash on the container:

```bash
docker-compose exec web bash
```

You can then run the usual Wagtail commands:

```bash
./manage.py collectstatic
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Backup and restore

#### Database

This site uses SQLite database. To backup / restore the database, simply copy and replace the `db.sqlite3` file. On local builds, this file is mounted as a bind mount, and will persist between docker builds unless explicitly deleted.

#### Media files (images and docs)

Similarly, the `media` (Wagtail Image and Document files) directory is mounted as a bind mount, and will persist between docker builds unless explicitly deleted. Likewise, it can be backed up and restored by simply copying and replacing the directory.


### To stop the container:

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

### Debugging

To tail the logs from the Docker containers in realtime, run:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Backend development

### Updating backend dependencies

To update pip packages, edit `requirements.in`, and then run:

```bash
pip-compile --allow-unsafe --generate-hashes
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Frontend development

Frontend css and js src files are in `static_src/` directory, and are compiled into `static_compiled/`. By default if not changing any frontend files, the CSS and JS should already be compiled on a fresh docker build.

For working with frontend files, see documentation about [Frontend tooling](https://github.com/victoriachan/developer-portfolio/blob/main/docs/frontend_tooling.md).
